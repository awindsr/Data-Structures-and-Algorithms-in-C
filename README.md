## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey through Data Structures and Algorithms using the C programming language. It includes a variety of exercises and problems I've solved to deepen my understanding of these fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Getting Started

To get started with these exercises:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Each folder in the repository represents a different category of data structures or algorithms.
- Navigate to the desired category and choose an exercise.
- Compile and run the C programs in your development environment.

## Exercise Categories

The exercises are organized into the following categories:

- **Arrays and Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Searching Algorithms**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees and Graphs**

Each category contains a set of problems and their solutions in C.
